### PAUL & NANCY

Paul and Nancy met at the International House of Prayer in Kansas City. Paul is from Virginia and Nancy is from Ontario, Canada. They have been in leadership of churches, movement, and houses of prayer for over 10 years.   Both Paul and Nancy feel called to be a voice to raise up women to walk in the fullness of their dreams and callings. The desire of the Lord's heart for women to be released and be set free from bondage in this hour is critical to the fullness of what God is doing in the earth and making a bride ready for the return of Jesus.   Esthers Arise mission is to empower women to fulfill God's promises on their lives through preparation, partnership, and obedience to our Lord Jesus Christ.  The Lord is inviting women to rise up like Esther for such a time as this.   Paul and Nancy reside in Raleigh, North Carolina and have two sons.
